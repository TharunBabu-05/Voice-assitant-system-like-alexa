# 🤖 Gemini AI Integration Guide

## Overview
Your voice assistant now supports Google Gemini AI integration, making it incredibly intelligent and capable of having natural conversations!

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account (the one with Gemini Premium)
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Configure Your Assistant
Run the setup script:
```bash
python3 setup_gemini.py
```

Or manually edit `config.py` and set:
```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
ENABLE_AI = True
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements
```bash
pip install requests
```

## 🎯 What Can Your AI Assistant Do?

### 🏠 Smart Home Commands (Hardware)
- "Turn on the lights"
- "Play some music"
- "What is the weather?"
- "Set volume to 5"

### 🧠 AI-Powered Conversations
- "What is quantum physics?"
- "Explain how solar panels work"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "What is the capital of France?"
- "How do I bake a cake?"
- "What is the meaning of life?"

### 📚 Educational Queries
- "Explain photosynthesis"
- "What are black holes?"
- "How does the internet work?"
- "Tell me about ancient Rome"

### �� Calculations & Problem Solving
- "What is 25% of 200?"
- "Convert 100 fahrenheit to celsius"
- "Solve this math problem: 2x + 5 = 15"

### 💡 Creative Tasks
- "Write a short poem about nature"
- "Give me cooking recipe ideas"
- "Suggest weekend activities"

## 🎨 LED Feedback System

Your assistant provides visual feedback through RGB LEDs:

- 🔵 **Blue Wave**: Wake word detected
- 🟢 **Green Breathing**: Listening for commands
- 🟡 **Orange Flow**: Processing/Speaking (includes AI thinking)
- 🔴 **Red Flash**: Error or not understood
- ⚫ **Off**: Idle/Ready

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Command Priority**: Hardware commands (lights, music) are processed first
2. **AI Fallback**: If no hardware command matches, AI analyzes the query
3. **Smart Routing**: The system automatically decides when to use AI vs local commands
4. **Context Aware**: AI receives current time and context for better responses

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# AI Settings
ENABLE_AI = True                    # Enable/disable AI features
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_key"         # Your Gemini API key
AI_MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH = 200        # Max response length (tokens)
AI_TEMPERATURE = 0.7                # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No AI Responses
- Check your API key is correct
- Ensure internet connection
- Verify `ENABLE_AI = True` in config

### API Errors
- Check your Gemini quota/billing
- Verify the API key has proper permissions
- Check console for error messages

### Slow Responses
- Normal for AI processing (2-5 seconds)
- Check your internet speed
- Consider reducing `AI_MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH`

## 🌟 Example Conversations

**User**: "Hey Pi, what is artificial intelligence?"
**Assistant**: "Artificial intelligence is technology that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving."

**User**: "Hey Pi, turn on the lights"
**Assistant**: *[Controls GPIO pins directly]*

**User**: "Hey Pi, tell me a joke"
**Assistant**: "Why dont scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

## 💰 Cost Considerations

- Gemini API has generous free tier
- Each query uses ~50-200 tokens
- Monitor usage at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Keep your API key private
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for production

Enjoy your super-intelligent Pi Assistant! 🎉
